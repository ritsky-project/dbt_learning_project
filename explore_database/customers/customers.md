# Bronze Customers Table Documentation

## Overview

The `bronze.customers` table constitutes the foundational customer master dataset utilized across downstream analytical engineering, data-quality standardization, transformation orchestration, and reporting workflows. The dataset integrates customer identity, contact, demographic, temporal, and geographic attributes consolidated from heterogeneous upstream operational systems.

Comprehensive profiling and transformation analysis revealed the presence of multiple real-world data-quality anomalies commonly observed in enterprise-scale ingestion environments, including but not limited to:

* structural inconsistencies
* semantic redundancy across attributes
* malformed and partially truncated records
* mixed regional formatting conventions
* incomplete customer identity information
* source-system standardization drift
* manual data-entry anomalies
* inconsistent temporal representations
* formatting heterogeneity across textual attributes

The principal objective of the transformation pipeline was to establish a defensible, auditable, and analytically reliable customer standardization framework capable of:

* profiling raw customer-domain data
* detecting structural and semantic inconsistencies
* standardizing valid business entities
* isolating malformed or unresolved records
* preserving transformation traceability
* improving downstream analytical reliability
* minimizing silent data corruption risk
* enabling reusable transformation logic for future ingestion workflows

# Removed Columns

The following attributes were removed during the optimization and standardization phase because they introduced semantic redundancy, increased maintenance overhead, or failed to provide additional business utility.

| Removed Column | Rationale                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| state          | Redundant relative to `state_abbr` and `state_full` |

# Geographic Data-Quality Optimization

## State Attribute Analysis

The original `state` attribute exhibited multiple quality deficiencies, including:

* inconsistent abbreviation usage
* duplicated full-state representations
* spelling inconsistencies
* semantically redundant geographic information
* mixed structural representations across records

## Final Engineering Decision

### Retained Attributes

* `state_abbr`
* `state_full`

### Removed Attribute

* `state`

### Rationale

The `state` column failed to provide incremental business value beyond the already standardized `state_abbr` and `state_full` attributes. Retaining the column would unnecessarily increase storage overhead, transformation complexity, and long-term maintenance costs.

# Defensive Engineering Principles Applied

The transformation framework intentionally prioritized the following engineering principles throughout the pipeline design lifecycle:

* preservation of data integrity
* transformation auditability
* conservative correction strategies
* defensive parsing methodologies
* ambiguity transparency
* malformed-record isolation
* downstream analytical reliability
* deterministic transformation preference
* prevention of silent data corruption

Potentially unsafe assumptions were intentionally avoided whenever deterministic validation could not be conclusively established.
